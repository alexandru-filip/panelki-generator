## Background and Design Principles
The Panelki Dataset was created through generative Autodesk Dynamo scripts, saved as Revit models and exported as images.  

#### Background
The original inspiration for building designs comes from a widespread building typology in the former USSR and its variations in former socialist countries, sometimes called 'Khrushchyovkas'. More information on the building typology and its history can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khrushchevka). 

The name "Panelki" is a nickname these buildings got in Poland. 

These buildings contain the doors and windows presented in the [PERDAW Dataset](https://github.com/alexandru-filip/perdaw-dataset) and the Panelki Dataset should be considered as a continuation of this work.
